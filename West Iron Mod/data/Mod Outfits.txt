The lower velocity is offset by the lack of energy use or heat generation - which, as a bonus, synergizes rather well with Static Pulse or Radiation Flare weapons. Although it is devastating to smaller ships like fighters and drones, it has little effect on capital ships and is best placed on a support ship."

The residual magnetic field around the slug allows it to puncture the target's shields, though it does slow the projectile down quite a bit."

The Dual Beam Laser is made for those pilots who don't agree; the natural stepping stone between Beam Lasers and Heavy Lasers."
